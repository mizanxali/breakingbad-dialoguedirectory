      <h1>HANK SCHRADER</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>My name is ASAC Schrader. And you can go fuck yourself.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>So be on notice: We got new players in town. Now we don’t know who they are or where they came from, but they possess an extremely high skill set. Me personally, I think Albuquerque might just have a new kingpin.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Chick’s got an ass like an onion… makes me wanna cry.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Sorry, buddy. No can do. Pain is my foot in your ass. Ooh, heyo... pool party! Hey, I don't get the gag, jackoff. Who is this? So... let me get this straight. You got this meth from 'some dude' wearing khaki pants, who - you're 80% sure - had a mustache. And that's it? That's your brain working at full capacity? It means I think your story's bullshit.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Marie, I said Cheetos, not Fritos. I must've said Cheetos like ten times. You need me to write it down for you? Well, I'm just saying, y'know, I said Cheetos. Ch-ch-ch sound. Virtually impossible to confuse Cheetos with Fritos it seems to me. Where are you going?</p>
      <hr>
      <p>So things are quiet, y'know? Not a lot of crystal on the streets right now. Well, we keep hearing a name. Heisenberg. Lately pretty much every dimebagger we come across. Yeah, I know. Maybe it's a tweaker urban legend. Still, somebody somewhere is cooking that big blue we keep finding. Come here... closer... Asshole.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>I think you know who Tuco Salamanca was. I think your car was there because you were there. Tuco had a bullet in him when I got there and I think you know something about that, too.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Sky, the, um... I know it's none of my business, but uh... keeping him away from the kids? Whoa, whoa, no heavy lifting. I got it. Jesus, what you got in there - cinder blocks? If I have to guess, I'd say that's Spanish for asshole. You? No. Only shooting that you do is into a Kleenex.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Our next three moves are sitting here and waiting. This here's the job buddy. Ain't all super models and speed boats, you know. Not a lot happening stateside. Hearing rumblings about some big play down south. Lots of bodies apparently. Y'know even by Cartel standards. We'll know more when the buzzards leave the bones.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>I mean we're definitely not talking, you know, bathtub crank here, this is a big ass operation. You know, hundred of pounds a week, maybe more. Other than the fact that he's deader than a Texas salad bar and has a decent set of pipes, I'd say he's my guy. There's this mystery man I've been chasing for the better part of a year. Cooks the purest meth that uh me or anyone else has ever seen. Goes by the name of Heisenberg. Yeah, pretty weird, huh?</p>
      <hr>
      <p>I looked him up it was one of these physicists, one of Hitler's guys, physicist named Werner Heisenberg - real cute huh? Anyway, I figure with a handle like that my guy's gotta be some sort of a, some sort of an of egg head. No offense. And here we go, Gale 'Major Tom' Boetticher. Anyway, I just wanna see if I'm you know, not barking up the wrong tree chemically speaking. Uh, as far as I can make out, he's writing about a phenylacetone cook, right? That's pretty rare these days, but it does jive with the blue stuff I've been tracking.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>That's a recipe for vegan s'mores. There's all kinds of crazy crap in there. He had like a top ten recumbent bicycles, indoor composting tips, all right next to the mother of methamphetamine syntheses. This guy was a uh, man he was a real character. Let me show you something. Right here, the top it says uh... 'to W.W. my star, my perfect silence.' W.W. who do you figure that is, you know? Woodrow Wilson, Willy Wonka... Walter White?</p>
      <hr>
      <p>I've been...unraveling, y'know? I don't sleep at night anymore. I freeze, I freeze up. My chest gets all tight, I can't breathe. Just...I panic [...] What I did to Pinkman...that's not who I'm supposed to be. All this, everything that's happened, I swear to God, Marie, I think the universe is trying to tell me something and I'm finally ready to listen. I'm just not the man I thought I was. I think I'm done as a cop.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>I walked sixteen feet in twenty minutes, which is up from like fifteen-and-a-half yesterday. And I had maybe this much less shit in my pants. So, yeah, Marie, if you and him and everybody else in America secretly took a vote and changed the meaning of the entire English language, yeah, I guess I broke new ground.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>It was you. All along, it was you! You son of a bitch. You drove into traffic to keep me from that laundry. That call I got telling me Marie was in the hospital...that wasn't Pinkman. You had my cell number. You killed ten witnesses to save your sorry ass. You bombed a nursing home. Heisenberg. Heisenberg! You lying, two-face sack of shit.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>I swear to Christ..... I will put you under the jail.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Skyler, my-- my head is spinning. And yours I-- I can't even imagine. So much makes sense to me now. You jumping in the pool, you sending us your kids, I get it. I just wished I'd seen it sooner. He's a monster. He's a Look, I don't know what he did to you to force you to keep his secrets. If he threatened you, or whatever mind games he played. I don't know if there was abuse. But I want you to know that you can be open with me. Don't hold anything back, okay? I mean, I don't even-- understand if you know the full extent of this, what he's done. Not just the meth cooking, but the lives he's destroyed. But, look, that's all behind you. Starting now. You're done being his victim. Because here's what we're gonna do. Sky. Here's what we're gonna do. You and the kids are gonna move back to our house where you'll be safe, where he can't get to you.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Look, the day I go in with this, it's the last day of my career, Marie. I'm going to have to walk in there, look those people in the eye and admit that the person I've been chasing the past year is my own brother-in-law. It's over for me. Ten seconds after I tell this story, I'm a civilian. Then how can we help Skyler if she comes to her senses? When I go in there, I'm bringing proof. Not suspicion. I can be the man who caught him, at least.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Walter White, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak to an attorney and have an attorney present during any questioning. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you at the government's expense. Do you understand these rights as I have just recited them to you?</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Hey, baby. I got him. Dead to rights. Yeah. I got him in handcuffs as we speak. Want me to wave to him for you? Huh? Well, he's not, uh-- he's not feeling too friendly. Things are gonna be a little rough for the next couple weeks, but they'll get better. Baby, you okay? I gotta go. It may be awhile before I get home. I love you.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>You want me to beg? You’re the smartest guy I ever met, and you’re too stupid to see—he made up his mind ten minutes ago.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Do what you're gonna do—</p>
