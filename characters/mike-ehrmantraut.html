    <p>Shut the fuck up and let me die in peace.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Walter, you've been busy. You wanna put your arms out to the sides for me if you would? You know I haven't slept since Thursday? I was out all night cleaning up after you. I need my sleep. Mmm... yeah, funny how words can be so open to interpretation. You get your car fixed? You're gonna want to get your car fixed.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>You... are trouble. I'm sorry the kid here doesn't see it, but I sure as hell do. You are a time bomb. Tick, tick, ticking. And I have no intention of being around for the boom. Well... you know how they say, it's been a pleasure? It hasn't.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Well, I guess that's it. Parting thoughts of which I have two. First: as I said I'll handle the legacy costs out of my end so you won't have to worry about my guys anymore. Second: the bug. The DEA will do a sweep can't say when, could be any time. But you need to get it out of there sooner rather than later. Alright. Just get the bug, Walter.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Goodbye, Walter.  I don't owe you a damn thing.  All of this -- falling apart like this -- is on YOU.  We had a good thing, you stupid son of a bitch!  We had Fring.  We had a lab.  We had everything we needed and it all ran like clockwork.  You could've shut your mouth, cooked, and made as much money as you ever needed.  It was perfect.  But no!  You just had to blow it up.  YOU!  And your pride and your ego.  You just had to be the man.  If you'd done your job, known your place, we'd all be fine right now.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Any other drugs in the house? Think hard; your freedom depends on it. What about guns, you got any guns in the house? Here's your story - You woke up, you found her, that's all you know. Say it. Say it, please. I woke up I found her that's all I know. Say it. I woke up I found her, that's all I know. Again. Again. Again.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Once you call it in, the people who show up with be with the office of medical investigations. it's primarily who you'll talk to. Police officers may arrive they may not, depends on how busy a morning they're having. Typically ODs are not a high priority call. There's nothing here to incriminate you, so I'd be amazed if you got placed under arrest. However, if you do, you say nothing. You tell them you just want your lawyer. And you call Saul Goodman.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>And do I need to state the obvious? I was not here. You put on a long sleeve shirt and cover those track marks on your arm. Count down from twenty, and then you dial. Hang tough, you're in the home stretch.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Hello, Walter. You're never gonna pay 'em off, what's the point? The only thing left to do now is leave town, you understand?</p>
    <hr>
    <p>I need your full attention, Saul. Jesse Pinkman current whereabouts. The sooner you tell me, the sooner you can get back to whatever the hell this is exactly. Whoa, you are good right there. Now lets both get comfortable. Now when I say I'm looking for Pinkman, we both know why, don't we. And you pretending otherwise only wastes my time and serves to annoy me. I trust the hole in the desert I'd leave you in. Don't make me beat you 'til your legs don't work. Now tell me where to find him, you know it's the right thing.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>I promise you this, either we're all going home or none of us are. Now settle down. On your feet.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>The next time you bring a gun to a job without telling me, I will stick it up your ass sideways. You understand?</p>
    <hr>
    <p>You know, I can foresee a lot of possible outcomes to this thing, and not a single one of them involves 'Miller Time.'</p>
