    <p>Yes. Why? Why is this still under discussion? No, no no no no no, I don't like him. I don't care who he knows. We're supposed to trust him with our product? Big Man. Big Generalissimo! Big fry cook is more like it... The 'Chicken Man.' You will do what you want. But you have my vote. Never trust a South American. Dirty, dirty people.</p>

    <p>He was just having fun. You'll get over it. Marco. Grab your old uncle a beer, would you? No, no. A cold one. This is what you wanted. Your brother dead. Right? You're going to have to try harder than that if you want to save him. How much longer do you think he has down there? One minute? Maybe more? Maybe less? Family is all.</p>

    <p>La familia es todo. What, you gonna tell? And you? They ain't gonna say nothing. They like what they see. Who says they're guests. If the boss wants them to drink, they drink.
